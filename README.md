# Godot healthbar/progressbar 3D

This is a simple node to display 3D healthbar.
It should have better perfomance than viewport method. Mainly because it does not create any viewports and just works with simple meshinstances. You can add multiple healthbars and dont worry about perfomance.

## Usage

just download this asset from godot asset library. Then just use your new healthbar3D node!
